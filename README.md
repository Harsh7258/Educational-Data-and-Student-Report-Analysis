## Objective – 
The objective of a project on Educational Data Analysis for Student Report
using Big Data Analytics is to leverage the power of **data analytics and mining** techniques to
identify **patterns, insights, and predictive** factors that can enhance students' academic
performance, improve teaching strategies, and optimize educational processes. Below are
specific objectives:
### Enhance Student Performance:
1. Use predictive analytics to identify at-risk students and provide targeted
interventions to improve their academic performance.

2. Develop insights into the factors affecting student success, such as attendance,
engagement, and learning habits.

# Educational Data Analytics Dashboard

This project is an **interactive data visualization dashboard** for **analyzing student performance, engagement metrics, and course trends** using **big data analytics** and **real-time reporting**.
